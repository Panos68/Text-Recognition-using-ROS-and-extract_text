# Text-Recognition-using-ROS-and-extract_text
This repository was created as part of my master thesis. It contains extract_text a file that was created by Jason Funk (https://github.com/jasonlfunk/ocr-text-extraction) and by using this, tesseract and ROS it supports directly text recognition through camera.
